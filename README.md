Nearing a Milestone in the DevOps sector, this is to provide a brief example of a skillset known as Network automation. It can take years to become a good Network engineer, and years also to be a good Linux administrator. But having both a combination of skills is rare, so I considered myself fortunate with my background. One can't automate what isn't understood, and the end goal of DevOps philosophy is the automation of infrastructure.

This video demonstration shows my playbooks configuring 3 switches for production use. Once we identified the cores & distributions switches, we nested them under a parent group "switches" to allow deployment of configurations to all layer 2 devices or a certain part in our network. As it is best practice to re-use tasks when possible, I created a couple tasks as a role "Switchprep" where I apply vlan 1-8 with description added on all switches. something VTP in Cisco isn't capable of, and Juniper can't mass deploy VLANs at all. I also enabled LLDP on every port, which for a manual project deployment would've taken hours to accomplish. For my Distro layer, I wish to assign VLANs to access ports, but each host will have its unique needs. For instance, Bob and Alice are physically on Gigaethernet port 2 on the west & south switch, respectively. But Bob is on vlan 2 as he is a residential client, while Alice uses vlan 3 and 4 since she is a business owner of a call center. As there are multiple ports & To accomplish this, I created host variables that my loop logic can refer to that apply changes when a key matches in them. South switch has a voice key pair so it'll have it applied to the ports assigned for it, while the task will skip West and proceed to setting the ones instead like residential.<img width="423" height="624" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fddf28a4-dd27-4e96-a4fc-5127b39a085c" />
