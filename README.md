Nearing a Milestone into the DevOps sector, This is to provide a brief example of a skillset known as Network automation. It can take years to become a good Network engineer, and years also to be a good Linux administrator, but having both combination of skills is rare so I considered myself fortunate with my background. One can't automate what isn't understooded, and a end goals to Devops philosphy is the automations of infrastructure.

per this video demostration, this shows my playbooks configuring 3 switches for production use. Ones we identified as cores & distributions switches we nested them under  a parent group "switches" to allow deployment of configurations to all layer 2 devices or a certain subnet in our network. As it best practice to re-use tasks when possible, I created mine as a role "Switchprep" where I apply vlan 1-8 with description added on all switches, something VTP in cisco isn't capable of and Juniper can't mass deploy vlans at all. I also enabled LLDP on every ports which for a manual project deployment would've taken hours to accomplish. For my Distro layer, I wish to assign  vlans to access ports, but each hosts will have it unique needs. for instance Bob and Alice are phyically on Gigaethernet port 2 on west & south switch respectively. Bob is on vlan 2 as he a residential client, while Alice uses vlan 3 and 4 since she a business owner of a call center. As this are multiple ports. To accomplish this I created host variables my loop logic can refer to that apply chances when a key matches in it.
